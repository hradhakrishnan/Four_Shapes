# Four_Shapes
A Tensorflow softmax model to train and predict shapes. 

The dataset used for this model is from the shapes dataset in kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/smeschke/four-shapes

All shape data are merged into a single tfrecord binary file, so that training steps can be randomized as much as possible.
